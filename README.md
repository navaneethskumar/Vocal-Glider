Pitch Shifter: implemented the pitch shifter using phase vocoder and controls the pitch of the vocal

Saturation & bias: Adds character and grit to the vocal. Users can apply distortion to the audio, opening up possibilities for edgier and non-conventional timbres.

Amplitude Modulation(Tremolo): Amplitude modulation is a powerful tool for sculpting evolving and dynamic sounds. It allows users to introduce amplitude change over time, giving the audio an edge in creating expressive sounds.

Gain Control: Gain control is crucial for achieving the right balance in audio output.
